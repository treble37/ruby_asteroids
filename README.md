# ruby_asteroids

##A ruby asteroids clone

###Instructions:

Left/right arrow keys rotate the ship

Up/down arrow keys speed up / slow down the ship


##Todos

* allow the asteroids to “float” in randomly assigned angles (for each asteroid) give it an angle upon initialization and let it slowly float along that line (wrapping at the screen edge)

* smooth out forward velocity of the ship is too fast for smooth action (try smaller step size)

* try a max speed that isn’t so fast it literally crashes Gosu

* graphics for ship, asteroids, and possibly sound

* try making an executable (and/or make a video demo)
